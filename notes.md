# To-DO
[x] I have my polymorphic relationship set up (captions are captionable). But is it set up correctly??? NOPE! Superclass mismatch error! Something is off with either: routes, controller namespacing, the index action (that's what I'm thinking most). 

[x] Having trouble creating a caption in Rails console, and even more trouble seeding my DB with my list of captions.

[x] Link my backend (Rails) to my frontend (React).
        Get the CSFR Token stuff set up (I know that will mean changing around my fetches a little with the correct header info, etc.)

        Are my routes correct and doing the right thing?

[x] Replace the captions fetch in React with rails/api captions json.

[x]  In React, have to create the following components:
        User sign-up/login form.
        Saved Memes show page (any saved meme, with name of user)
        Saved Gifs show page (any saved gifs, with name of user)
      [x]  User profile page that shows only that user's saved memes and gifs.

[x]join table: joining a captions to captionable
    join table CaptionCaptionable

    captions has_many CaptionCaptionable, 
    has_many captionable through captionCaptionable

[x] user 
   [x] on: :create, for password_confirmation
   [x] display error validations:
        [x] error component with Error styled.div card
        [x] in signup form, conditional to check for errors, calls renderError() if there are errors
        [x] in User reducer store errors in state, new initial state of errors
